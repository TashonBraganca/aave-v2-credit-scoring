# Wallet Credit Score Analysis

## Introduction
This document provides an analysis of the credit scores assigned to Aave V2 wallets based on their historical transaction behavior. The scores range from 0 to 1000, reflecting perceived reliability and responsibility.

## Wallet Scoring Process Recap
The credit scores were generated using an XGBoost Regressor model. The model was trained on a set of engineered features derived from raw Aave V2 transaction data (e.g., transaction counts, total deposit/borrow amounts, repayment ratios, wallet age). Since no ground truth scores were available, a heuristic-based scoring system was initially used to create target labels for training the model. This heuristic penalized risky behaviors (like liquidation calls, high leverage) and rewarded responsible actions (like consistent deposits, high repayment rates, and long-term engagement).

## Score Distribution Graph
*This section will contain a histogram or density plot of the generated credit scores. Generate this after running the full scoring script and having the `wallet_credit_scores.csv` file.*

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the generated scores
scores_df = pd.read_csv('wallet_credit_scores.csv')

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(scores_df['credit_score'], bins=range(0, 1001, 100), kde=True, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Distribution of Aave V2 Wallet Credit Scores (0-1000)')
plt.xlabel('Credit Score Range')
plt.ylabel('Number of Wallets')
plt.xticks(range(0, 1001, 100))
plt.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.75)
plt.show()

print("\nDescriptive statistics of the credit scores:")
print(scores_df['credit_score'].describe())
```

**Observations:**
- *(Describe the shape of the distribution: Is it normal, skewed? Are there many wallets at the extremes (0 or 1000)? What does this tell you about the overall behavior in the dataset?)*

---

## Behavior of Wallets in the Lower Range (e.g., 0-300)
*Analyze wallets with low scores. Pick a few sample wallets from the `wallet_credit_scores.csv` and cross-reference their `userWallet` with the `wallets_df` (from Phase 2) to see their engineered features. Explain why they received low scores based on your model's logic and the features.*

**Typical Characteristics of Low-Scoring Wallets:**
- High number of `liquidationCall` actions (as indicated by `liquidationCall_count`).
- Very low or zero `repay_to_borrow_ratio` (indicating failure to repay borrowed funds).
- High `borrow_to_deposit_ratio` (suggesting excessive leverage).
- Short `wallet_age_days` combined with significant borrowing/liquidation activity.

*Add specific examples from your data if possible.*

---

## Behavior of Wallets in the Higher Range (e.g., 700-1000)
*Analyze high-scoring wallets. Pick samples and explain their features.*

**Typical Characteristics of High-Scoring Wallets:**
- Consistent and high `net_deposit` values.
- `repay_to_borrow_ratio` close to or greater than 1 (indicating full or over-repayment).
- Zero `liquidationCall_count`.
- Long `wallet_age_days` and consistent `total_transactions`.
- Low `borrow_to_deposit_ratio` or responsible management of borrowed funds.

*Add specific examples from your data if possible.*

## Feature Importance Analysis
*After training your XGBoost model in Phase 3, you can extract feature importances. This section will show which features the model found most influential in determining the credit score.*

```python
# Assuming 'model' (XGBRegressor) and 'X_train_scaled_df' (from Phase 3) are available
# If running this independently, load the model and scaler, then re-create X_predict_scaled_df
# with the same feature names as during training.

# Example:
# model = joblib.load('aave_credit_score_model.pkl')
# scaler = joblib.load('aave_credit_score_scaler.pkl')
# # Re-engineer features for all wallets and scale them
# all_wallets_features = engineer_features_for_scoring(df_full_raw_data) # Assuming df_full_raw_data is loaded
# X_all_scaled = scaler.transform(all_wallets_features[model.feature_names_in_])

# Get feature importances
feature_importances = pd.Series(model.feature_importances_, index=X_train_scaled_df.columns).sort_values(ascending=False)

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.barplot(x=feature_importances.values, y=feature_importances.index, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Feature Importance for Aave V2 Credit Score Model')
plt.xlabel('Importance Score')
plt.ylabel('Feature')
plt.show()

print("\nTop 10 most important features:")
print(feature_importances.head(10))
```

**Discussion:**
- *(Discuss which features were most important and why you think they contributed significantly to the credit score. For example, if `liquidationCall_count` is highly important, it means the model strongly penalizes wallets involved in liquidations. If `repay_to_borrow_ratio` is high, it indicates responsible repayment behavior is a key factor.)*

## Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations of the Current Model:
- **Heuristic-Dependent Labels:** The model learns to predict a heuristic score, not a true, human-labeled credit score. The quality of the model is therefore limited by the quality of the heuristic.
- **Limited Feature Set:** Only transaction-level data from Aave V2 is used. External on-chain data (e.g., overall wallet history, other DeFi protocol interactions) is not included.
- **Static Scoring:** The current model provides a single score based on all historical data. A dynamic, time-decaying score might be more relevant for real-time risk assessment.
- **No External Validation:** Without a true labeled dataset, external validation of the credit score's real-world accuracy (e.g., predicting defaults) is not possible.

### Future Work:
- **Refine Heuristic:** Collaborate with DeFi experts to refine the heuristic scoring logic for more accurate proxy labels.
- **Incorporate External Data:** Integrate data from other DeFi protocols, CEX interactions, or general blockchain activity to create a more comprehensive profile.
- **Time-Series Modeling:** Explore recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or Transformers to model the sequence of transactions directly, potentially capturing more nuanced behavioral patterns.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Use clustering or anomaly detection techniques to identify distinct wallet behaviors (e.g., bots, whales, regular users) and inform credit scoring.
- **Interpretability Tools:** Employ advanced interpretability techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to provide more granular explanations for individual wallet scores.
